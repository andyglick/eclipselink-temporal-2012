Eclipselink Temporal circa 2012
===============================

Have been working on the 2.3.1 branch, look there to see what I've been up to.

There has been a project, eclipselink temporal in the Eclipse git repo for a many years now. No one seems to have worked on it since 2012.

Given that I prefer Eclipselink to Hibernate and being interested in Temporal Database issues for a long time I thought to get it out of their git and brush it off. So I have moved it to github and am in the process of migrating the code to a Maven build.

I've been working woith the temportal-entity-example module.

I've been stumbling around a small number of issues but hope to make fairly rapid progress.
