EclipseLink JPA: Temporal Entity Example


This example implements an interpretation of the temporal object pattern (Fowler). In this example entities have current and future planned editions.

CURRENT

EDITION (Effective)

CONTINUITY: The continuity refers to the current or first future edition where this object exists. 
			In this example the continuity edition will have the same CID and OID.
